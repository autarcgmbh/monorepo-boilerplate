## How to run

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts both the client (Vite) and the server (Node.js + PGlite) in development mode.

## Go server (core team only)

If you're working on the Go server (`apps/server-v2`), make sure you have Go installed, then from the project root:

```
make dev
```
